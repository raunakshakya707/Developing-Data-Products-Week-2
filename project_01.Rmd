#### **Overview**

In this assignment, I have created a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet and host my webpage on GitHub Pages. The webpage contains the date that I created the document, anda map created with Leaflet.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
map <- map %>% 
  addMarkers(lat=27.71068, lng= 85.3062413, popup="My House") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=27.720908,lng=85.316656, popup="British Council, Kathmandu") %>%
  addMarkers(lat=27.680955,lng=85.318763, popup="IOE Pulchowk, Patan")
map
```
